# Estimation of selection against mitonuclear incompatibilities with SELAM  

This program uses an ABC framework to estimate selection coefficients against
mitonuclear incompatibilities by simulating admixed populations with the 
forward-time population genetic simulator SELAM (Corbett-Detig & Jones 2016).
